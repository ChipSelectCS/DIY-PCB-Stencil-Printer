## Description
Enhance your PCB creation with proper tools, such as this affordable and easy to manufacture and use PCB Stencil Printer.

## What files to use
As of now download Version1 as it has proven to work the best.
You will see STL files ready to be 3D printed. Additionally, you can import .obj files in centimeters units for modification in any software. For best editing experience use Fusion 360 and attached f3d files.

## How to make
In the downloaded folder you will see 3 STL files/pieces needed to make the PCB Stencil Printer. I suggest first printing the BOTTOM piece and measuring its thickness to match the thickness of your desired PCB. For instance, the standard PCB size is 1.6mm, thus the model by default is 1.6mm thick. You should use RAFT in your slicer to achieve precise z-axis size.
If you can't achieve precise BOTTOM piece height, you can add a safety margin by printing for example 2mm and then using several layers of tape under PCB to adjust the height precisely if you want.
*There must not be any air gap between the stencil and PCB.
Find a suitable piece of wood to mount the assembly onto. Drill a few holes and screw in the screws of diameters #8-32 (American) or M4 (metric). Both of these diameters are about 4mm. The length of the screws should be about 20mm to fit the "lock washer" and "nut".
Tighten the screws and nuts to achieve a tight grip on the stencil. You won't have to adjust the screws anymore since it is pretty easy to insert and remove the stencil as is.

## How to use
Carefully insert the stencil by sliding it into the gap of top and bottom pieces, screwdriver may help to push the stencil around.
Slide PCB under the stencil with the help of an angle which is the third printed + looking piece. Push the PCB into the corner of the Holder and fix it in place with the angle by taping the angle to the table.
Apply a generous amount of solder paste on one side of the stencil. Use a plastic card or dedicated tool to slowly distribute/move the solder paste across the surface of the stencil while applying good pressure.
*YOU MUST ONLY SLIDE THE SOLDER PASTE ACROSS SURFACE >ONCE< PER EACH PCB. THIS IS HOW IT MUST BE DONE WITH EVERY PCB PRINTING SETUP REGARDLESS INDUSTRIAL OR DIY.
Gently untape the angle and move it away.
Lift up the stencil (it should bend in the process) to carefully slide out the PCB.

*Remember to clean the bottom of the stencil after 1 or 2 swipes. This involves taking the stencil out and wiping off the solder paste accumulated on the bottom. (Problem to be fixed in the future)
